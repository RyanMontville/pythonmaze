# Python Maze Generator
Generate a maze in Python using [Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

3/27: First attempt at randomly generating a maze. The program randomly chooses if the next segment should be drawn in or not, then moves forwards 20 until it reaches the edge of the maze, then moves over 20 and goes again until it reaches the other edge of the maze. The generated maze most likely does not have a possible path from start to finish. This is more of a test to see what randomly generating the segments would do.

Here is an example of a randomly generated maze:
